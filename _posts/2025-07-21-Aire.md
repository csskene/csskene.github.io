This post explains how to get started with [Dedalus](https://dedalus-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) on Aire. For general Aire documentation [see here](https://arcdocs.leeds.ac.uk/aire/welcome.html).

## :wrench: Full Stack Installation
In order to set up Dedalus, we will follow a slightly modified version of the [full stack](https://dedalus-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/installation.html#full-stack-conda-installation-recommended) instructions. This will create a self-contained conda environment with everything needed to run Dedalus.

First, load the miniforge module and create a dedalus environment:
```bash
module load miniforge
source activate base
mamba create -n dedalus
```
Then, activate the environment and install Dedalus:
```bash
source activate dedalus
mamba install dedalus openmpi ucx
```
At this point, your Dedalus environment is ready to use. We explicitly install openmpi and ucx to enable Omni-Path support. This is **important** as it allows us to use Omni-Path by specifying the environment variables:
```bash
export OMPI_MCA_pml=ucx
export OMPI_MCA_osc=ucx
```
which should be set in any job script that uses more than one node. As always, also set these variables:
```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
export NUMEXPR_MAX_THREADS=1
```
to ensure Dedalus does not use multithreading by default.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Custom Installation
If a custom version of Dedalus is required then first follow the above instructions. Then clone the required repository, for example:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:DedalusProject/dedalus.git
```
Next install missing dependencies and install Dedalus from source using pip:
```bash
mamba install openmpi-mpicc cython setuptools
cd <path/to/dedalus/repo>
CC=mpicc pip3 install --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-deps --no-cache --no-build-isolation .
```

---
## :white_check_mark: Testing the Installation
To test that the environment works, activate the environment and run:
```bash
python3 -m dedalus test
```
